Fun with [Celluloid](http://celluloid.io/) [Puma](http://puma.io) and [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/)

This is a sandbox for experimenting with augmenting existing Sinatra apps with Celluloid. 

If this is interesting to you and you aren't locked into a legacy-ish application then you may
be more interested in looking at [Reel](https://github.com/celluloid/reel).
